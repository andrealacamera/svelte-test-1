# SVELTE-TEST-1

## Intro 
This is my first project with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), based on the Traversy Media Youtube video (see ref below).

Added TailwindCSS as I always do!

Several differences between video and current project are present. A few of these because Svelte changed (installation, version, etc). Other differences are due to my personal choices.
